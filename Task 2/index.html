                        <li>His parents were computer scientist who worked for the first commercially built computer the feranti mark 1.</li>
                        <li>He attended Sheen Mount Primary School and then went on to attend South West London's Emmanuel school from 1969 to 1973.</li>

                        <li>After leaving CERN in 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer systems.</li>
                        <li>In 1984 he returned back to CERN In 1989 CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw the opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet.</li>
                        <li>Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and in 1990 redistributed it. in 1994 he founded W3Cin Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</li>
                        <li>In November 2009 Berners-Lee launched WWWF inorder to compaign toadvance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change.</li>
